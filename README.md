*Description:* Social Analyzer - API, CLI, and Web App for analyzing & finding a person's profile across +1000 social media \ websites. It includes different analysis and detection modules, and you can choose which modules to use during the investigation process.

The detection modules utilize a rating mechanism based on different detection techniques, which produces a rate value that starts from 0 to 100 (No-Maybe-Yes). This module is intended to have fewer false positives.

The analysis and public extracted information from this OSINT tool could help investigate profiles related to suspicious or malicious activities such as cyberbullying, cyber grooming, cyberstalking, and spreading misinformation..
